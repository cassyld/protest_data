### Replication for descriptive figures (Figures 1-4)

Replication files for each figure are separated into their own executable R file. Necessary packages are included in each. Figures associated with main modeling results are included in the modeling file and are clearly marked.

1. Figure 1: "Spatial and temporal coverage, 13 datasets", see `figure_1.R` (pass)
2. Figure 2: "Temporal coverage across CCC and ACLED", see `figure_2.R` (pass)
3. Figure 3: "Social media as a source in ACLED and CCC", see `figure_3.R` (pass)
4. Figures 4 & 5: (Maps) Spatial distribution of protests, ACLED & CCC, see `figure_4_5.R` (pass)

### Replication for descriptive tables (Tables 1-6)

1. See R file "tables_1_6.R"

- table 1 (pass)
- table 2 (pass)
- table 3 (pass)
- table 4 (pass)
- table 5 (pass)
- table 6 (pass)

### Replication of main models

1. For the main models in the manuscript, including their graphics and tabular versions in the appendix, see:

- `models_1_2.R` (pass)
- `models_3_4.R` (pass)

###  Replication of appendix materials

1. See "tables_app.R" for all code to replicate descriptive tables in the appendix

- table 2 (pass)
- table 3 (pass)

2. See the following appendix modeling files for supplemental models:

- `models_5_6_app.R` (pass)
- `models_7_8_app.R` (pass)
- `models_9_10_app.R` (pass)
- `models_11_12_app.R` (pass)
