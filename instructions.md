### Replication for descriptive figures (Figures 1-4)

Replication files for each figure are separated into their own executable R file. Necessary packages are included in each. Figures associated with main modeling results are included in the modeling file and are clearly marked.

1. Figure 1: "Spatial and temporal coverage, 13 datasets", see `figure1.R`
2. Figure 2: "Temporal coverage across CCC and ACLED", see `figure2.R`
3. Figure 3: "Social media as a source in ACLED and CCC", see `figure3.R`
4. Figures 4 & 5: (Maps) Spatial distribution of protests, ACLED & CCC, see `figure4_5.R`

### Replication for descriptive tables (Tables 1-6)

1. See R file "tables.R"

### Replication of main models

1. For the main models in the manuscript, including their graphics and tabular versions in the appendix, see:

- `models1_2.R`
- `models3_4.R`

###  Replication of appendix materials

1. See "appendix_tables.R" for descriptive tables
2. See the following appendix modeling files for supplemental models:

- `models5_6.R`
- `models7_8.R`
- `models9_10.R`
- `models11_12.R`
